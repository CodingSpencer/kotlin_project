# Overview

My goal was to use Kotlin to program the needed code for a quiz app that would test a user's knowledge on Captain America.

Using classes, I attempted to program a system that would be able to randomly select a question from a list of pre-made options, display that option to the user, and create a score board to keep track of how many questions the user has gotten correct.

Writing this software will hopefully allow this project to continue into this next sprint. With the background code already established I can hopefully discover how to connect it to an android system program.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
